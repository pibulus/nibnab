## The Vibe Section

### Section Title
**Why NibNab exists**

### Content
Every clipboard manager is either too complicated, too simple, or too corporate.

**Too complicated?** We don't need 47 features and a settings panel that scrolls.

**Too simple?** A chronological list isn't organization, it's procrastination.

**Too corporate?** Why does copying text require an account, a subscription, and "AI-powered insights"?

NibNab is the 80/20 version. Does less. Does it better.

## Anti-Scale Philosophy Section

### Section Title
**This will never have:**

### List
- ‚ùå A pricing page
- ‚ùå A login screen
- ‚ùå A "pro" version
- ‚ùå Analytics
- ‚ùå Your email address
- ‚ùå Cloud sync drama
- ‚ùå Feature bloat

### Closing
**Just a tool that does one thing well and respects you.**

## FAQ Section

### What does NibNab capture?
Everything you copy with Cmd+C, plus selected text (with accessibility permission). Only text‚Äîno images or files.

### Where is my data stored?
Locally on your Mac in `~/.nibnab/` as markdown files. No cloud. No sync. You own it.

### Does it work offline?
Yes. NibNab never connects to the internet. Ever.

### What are the colors for?
Whatever you want! Organize by project, content type, priority, or just vibe. The colors have no predefined meaning.

### How many clips can I save?
100 clips per color (400 total). When you hit the limit, oldest clips auto-delete. Or delete manually anytime.

### Can I export my clips?
Yes! Two formats:
- **Markdown** - With app names and timestamps
- **Plain Text** - Just the clips

### Does it sync across devices?
No. NibNab is local-only by design. No sync = no sync conflicts, no privacy concerns, no subscription.

### Is it really free?
Yes. No trial, no freemium, no "pro" version. Free means free.

### What about privacy?
NibNab doesn't track anything. No analytics, no telemetry, no "anonymous usage data." Your clips stay on your Mac.

### Can I edit the stored files?
Absolutely! They're plain markdown in `~/.nibnab/`. Edit, backup, grep, do whatever you want.

### What's the catch?
There isn't one. I built this because existing clipboard managers annoyed me. Maybe it'll help you too.
