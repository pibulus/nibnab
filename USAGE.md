# NibNab - Quick Usage Guide

> Color-coded clipboard collector for macOS
> **"Your clipboard deserves better"**

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# From the nibnab directory:
./install.sh
```

This will:
- Build the latest version
- Kill any running instance
- Install to /Applications
- Optionally launch the app

## üéØ Quick Start

### First Launch
1. Launch from Spotlight: `Cmd+Space` ‚Üí type "nibnab"
2. Look for the **highlighter icon** in your menubar
3. Click it to open the clip collector

### Daily Usage

**Global Shortcut**: `Cmd+Shift+V` - Opens NibNab from anywhere

**Copying Text**:
1. Copy anything (`Cmd+C`)
2. Color picker appears near your cursor (3 second window)
3. Click a color to save the clip
4. Or ignore it and it disappears

**Viewing Clips**:
- Click menubar icon or use `Cmd+Shift+V`
- Click color circles at bottom to switch categories
- Click any clip to copy it back to clipboard

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings (In Header)

- **Monitor** - Watch clipboard for changes
- **Auto-copy** - Captures text when you select it (experimental)
- **Auto-launch** - Start NibNab on login

## üé® The Colors

NibNab uses vintage highlighter colors for organizing:

- **Yellow** (#f5f617) - Default, general purpose
- **Orange** (#f68717) - Important, urgent
- **Pink** (#f60474) - Ideas, creative
- **Purple** (#8717f6) - Code, technical

Use them however you want - they're just colors!

## üìÅ Storage

All clips saved to: `~/.nibnab/[color-name]/`

Each clip is a markdown file with:
- Timestamp
- Source app name
- The copied text
- Optional URL (if copied from browser) - *coming soon*

**Limits**: 100 clips per color (oldest auto-deleted)

## üîß Development

### Building
```bash
./build.sh              # Builds to build/NibNab.app
open build/NibNab.app   # Run locally without installing
```

### Installing
```bash
./install.sh            # Full install workflow
```

Or manually:
```bash
./build.sh
cp -r build/NibNab.app /Applications/
open /Applications/NibNab.app
```

### Rebuilding & Relaunching
```bash
pkill NibNab && ./build.sh && open build/NibNab.app
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Menubar icon not showing?**
- The app is menubar-only (no dock icon by design)
- Look for the highlighter icon in your menubar
- Use Spotlight to launch if needed

**Keyboard shortcut not working?**
- macOS may need accessibility permissions
- Check System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Accessibility
- Add NibNab if prompted

**Color picker not appearing?**
- Make sure "Monitor" toggle is ON
- The picker only shows for 3 seconds after copying
- Try copying again

**Launch at Login not working?**
- Toggle it OFF then ON again
- Check System Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Login Items
- NibNab should be listed there

## üé∏ Philosophy

NibNab is designed around **compression over complexity**:

- **Four colors** - Not a hundred tags
- **Local markdown** - Not a cloud database
- **Menubar only** - Not another window to manage
- **One feature** - Collect clips by color, that's it

The goal is to reduce friction in capturing useful bits while maintaining creative chaos.
