**Your clipboard deserves better than Cmd+V into Notes.app**

NibNab is a menubar clipboard manager that captures everything you copy and organizes it into four color-coded collections. It's the simplest way to keep track of the good bits‚Äîquotes, links, code snippets, random thoughts‚Äîwithout the complexity of traditional clipboard managers.

**HOW IT WORKS**

1. Copy anything (Cmd+C or select text)
2. It auto-captures to your active color
3. View, export, or delete anytime

That's it. No interruptions. No "should I save this?" decisions. Just copy and it's there.

**SMART CAPTURE**

‚Ä¢ Monitors Cmd+C clipboard changes
‚Ä¢ Auto-captures text selections (with accessibility permission)
‚Ä¢ Saves to your active color automatically
‚Ä¢ Menubar icon shows current color with visual feedback

**FOUR COLORS, YOUR RULES**

üü° Yellow
üü† Orange
ü©∑ Pink
üü£ Purple

The colors mean whatever you want:
‚Ä¢ Organize by project (work, side hustle, personal, learning)
‚Ä¢ Organize by type (links, text, code, commands)
‚Ä¢ Organize by action (to read, to reply, to share, to archive)

**POWERFUL ORGANIZATION**

‚Ä¢ Search across all clips instantly
‚Ä¢ Sort by date, source app, or length
‚Ä¢ View full clip details with timestamp
‚Ä¢ Copy or delete with one click
‚Ä¢ Keyboard shortcut (Cmd+Shift+V) for quick access

**TWO EXPORT OPTIONS**

Export as Markdown (with metadata):
‚Ä¢ Includes source app names
‚Ä¢ Timestamps for each clip
‚Ä¢ Perfect for documentation and sharing

Export as Plain Text:
‚Ä¢ Just the clips with clean separators
‚Ä¢ No metadata, no noise
‚Ä¢ Ready to paste anywhere

**SETTINGS THAT MAKE SENSE**

Right-click the menubar icon to access:
‚Ä¢ Launch at login
‚Ä¢ Sound effects toggle (subtle audio feedback)
‚Ä¢ Color switching
‚Ä¢ About and quit

**PRIVACY FIRST**

‚Ä¢ Everything stored locally in ~/.nibnab/
‚Ä¢ Plain markdown files you can read and edit
‚Ä¢ No cloud sync, no accounts, no tracking
‚Ä¢ Zero network requests
‚Ä¢ You own your data, period

**THE ANTI-SCALE APPROACH**

NibNab will never have:
‚Ä¢ A pricing page (it's free)
‚Ä¢ A login screen
‚Ä¢ A "pro" version
‚Ä¢ Analytics or telemetry
‚Ä¢ Your email address

Built by one person who believes good tools should:
‚Ä¢ Do one thing well
‚Ä¢ Respect your privacy
‚Ä¢ Work forever
‚Ä¢ Feel alive

**TECH DETAILS**

‚Ä¢ Native Swift/SwiftUI app
‚Ä¢ Requires macOS 13.0 or later
‚Ä¢ Apple Silicon optimized
‚Ä¢ Single-file architecture (~1200 lines)
‚Ä¢ No external dependencies
‚Ä¢ Lightweight and fast

**WHO IT'S FOR**

‚Ä¢ Writers collecting research
‚Ä¢ Developers saving code snippets
‚Ä¢ Designers gathering inspiration
‚Ä¢ Students organizing notes
‚Ä¢ Anyone who copies stuff and wants to find it later

**WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED**

‚Ä¢ Cloud sync (by design)
‚Ä¢ Team features (it's personal)
‚Ä¢ AI suggestions (you decide what matters)
‚Ä¢ Premium upsells (there aren't any)

**GETTING STARTED**

1. Install NibNab
2. Grant accessibility permission (optional, for auto-capture)
3. Start copying stuff
4. Use the menubar icon or Cmd+Shift+V to view clips

That's it. No tutorial, no onboarding, no account creation. Just open it and it works.
