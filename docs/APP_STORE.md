**Your clipboard deserves better than Cmd+V into Notes.app**

NibNab is a menubar clipboard manager that captures everything you copy and organizes it into four color-coded collections. It's the simplest way to keep track of the good bits—quotes, links, code snippets, random thoughts—without the complexity of traditional clipboard managers.

**HOW IT WORKS**

1. Copy anything (Cmd+C or select text)
2. It auto-captures to your active color
3. View, export, or delete anytime

That's it. No interruptions. No "should I save this?" decisions. Just copy and it's there.

**SMART CAPTURE**

• Monitors Cmd+C clipboard changes
• Auto-captures text selections (with accessibility permission)
• Saves to your active color automatically
• Menubar icon shows current color with visual feedback

**FOUR COLORS, YOUR RULES**

🟡 Yellow
🟠 Orange
🩷 Pink
🟣 Purple

The colors mean whatever you want:
• Organize by project (work, side hustle, personal, learning)
• Organize by type (links, text, code, commands)
• Organize by action (to read, to reply, to share, to archive)

**POWERFUL ORGANIZATION**

• Search across all clips instantly
• Sort by date, source app, or length
• View full clip details with timestamp
• Copy or delete with one click
• Keyboard shortcut (⌘⌃N) for quick access

**TWO EXPORT OPTIONS**

Export as Markdown (with metadata):
• Includes source app names
• Timestamps for each clip
• Perfect for documentation and sharing

Export as Plain Text:
• Just the clips with clean separators
• No metadata, no noise
• Ready to paste anywhere

**SETTINGS THAT MAKE SENSE**

Right-click the menubar icon to access:
• Launch at login
• Sound effects toggle (subtle audio feedback)
• Color switching
• About and quit

**PRIVACY FIRST**

• Everything stored locally in ~/.nibnab/
• Plain markdown files you can read and edit
• No cloud sync, no accounts, no tracking
• Zero network requests
• You own your data, period

**THE ANTI-SCALE APPROACH**

NibNab will never have:
• A pricing page (it's free)
• A login screen
• A "pro" version
• Analytics or telemetry
• Your email address

Built by one person who believes good tools should:
• Do one thing well
• Respect your privacy
• Work forever
• Feel alive

**TECH DETAILS**

• Native Swift/SwiftUI app
• Requires macOS 13.0 or later
• Apple Silicon optimized
• Single-file architecture (~1200 lines)
• No external dependencies
• Lightweight and fast

**WHO IT'S FOR**

• Writers collecting research
• Developers saving code snippets
• Designers gathering inspiration
• Students organizing notes
• Anyone who copies stuff and wants to find it later

**WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED**

• Cloud sync (by design)
• Team features (it's personal)
• AI suggestions (you decide what matters)
• Premium upsells (there aren't any)

**GETTING STARTED**

1. Install NibNab
2. Grant accessibility permission (optional, for auto-capture)
3. Start copying stuff
4. Use the menubar icon or ⌘⌃N to view clips

That's it. No tutorial, no onboarding, no account creation. Just open it and it works.

• Optional sound effects with toggle
• Launch at login support
• Global keyboard shortcuts (⌘⌃N to toggle, ⌘⌃1-5 to switch colors)
• Search and sort functionality
• Privacy-first local storage (no cloud, no tracking)

• Dark-themed interface

This is v1.0 because it does what it says. No beta, no "coming soon" features, no incomplete implementations. It's done, it works, and it's ready.

Future updates will be thoughtful additions, not feature bloat. If it makes the app more complex, it probably doesn't belong.
